UI for the CarameloSwap DEX
# CarameloSwap

CarameloSwap is a DEX (decentralized exchange) based on the UniswapV1 protocol(written in vyper), CarameloSwap is written in Solidity and has its own governance token called CaSw. In the next updates I will implement the diamond proxy pattern and give decision power to the CaSw token this way turning CarameloSwap into a true DAO.

Caramelo is running on rinkeby testnet at 0xb89c2D7813189634c078B3d0263fCc6D1de543A0 and has his own UI.
the CaSw token address at rinkeby testnet: 0xc91a58f768fF355c012928b5c7468eF735AAd806

## Running

Setup your wallet to rinkeby testnet(make sure that you have some faucet ether tokens for rinkeby testnet).

Clone this repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/esdras-santos/carameloswap-ui

correctly:
